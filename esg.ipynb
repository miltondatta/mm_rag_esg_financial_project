It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

       "\" ESG, real or marketing? It's a complete fraud. Complete fraud. It's so ridiculous. Governance has been addressed. That's useful. But this idea that you're going to get a stamp that says, oh, listen, my supplier, I've offset their carbon credits and now I understand my... It's a joke. It's jargon. And I think what people are doing right now is using it as a way to, for example, if you can paint yourself as ESG, in Europe you can essentially borrow money from the ECB at negative rates. I can do you a massage now. It's a carry-trade. He doesn't want you touching him. Coronavirus. Go Chamath. Go Chamath. Hold on. But I personally believe in climate change. I know. I think we need to do something. And so the problem with ESG is it's going to take years for this... But when you hear JP Morgan yesterday say they're not going to finance fossil fuels or you hear Ed Bastien at Delta say he's going to spend $100 million, real money by the way, effectively buying carbon offsets and investing in new biofuels every year, you say... JP Morgan, by saying what they said, will be able to borrow billions of dollars from the ECB at negative rates. You think that's what that is? It's obviously what it is. It doesn't have to work. They don't need to do anything. They are now getting free money from Europe for basically being able to say this. And you don't think they would get that money otherwise? No, because Europe basically has this condition where you can issue green bonds and you can have all of this, you know, checks and balances. So that's one thing. It's going to be very important for you to really be able to diligence the supply chain all the way down to the supplier and the supplier's supplier. So when you saw Microsoft to say they're going to do, for example... These are useful statements. It's great marketing. But again, it's a lot of sizzle, no stake. I think that what we need to do is invest in actual companies that can go and count and can go and, you know, legitimize the actual impact that companies have so that you can do the right amount of carbon offsets. And then you have to have a legitimate exchange where you can actually trade them. So if you really believe in climate change, you've got to do some hard work now. By the way, Virgin Galactic is going to be throwing off a lot of carbon. Do you buy offsets? Galactica. Galactica. Yeah, we have a plan to sort of get to sustainability. You do? Why? If it's all... Because it's important. He believes it. He just said he believes it.\""
